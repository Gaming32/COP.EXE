# COP.EXE

```
Hello and welcome!
You have been hired as the new operator of our
robot police officer, COP.EXE.
Type "help" for help.
```

...begins this text-based adventure about bringing a robber to justice.

You will find that although looking at the map is easy, controlling your robot may not be so easy as WASD... you have been warned.

## Text commands and movement

```
The basic commands are:
 - help
 - echo
 - credits
 - clear
To move around, use one of the following commands
followed by a space and the number of blocks to
move (you can move up to two blocks):
 - left
 - right
 - up
 - down
```

You can move up to two blocks in a single turn, but the enemy can only move one (except very occasionally he will move two).

## Running the game

This game requires Python 3.9 or later, as well as PyGame 2.0.0 or later.
You can run the game by running the `run_game.py` file with Python.
